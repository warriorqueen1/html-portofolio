<p>This movie motivated me to be a coral researcher. It was a very insprational documentary (it was actually one of the reason I want to take the python class by Angela too).</p>
<h3>Where the Crawdad Sing</h3>

<p>A very peculiar story that brings you into a roller-coaster of emotions. I believe this is one of the best mobie adaptation from books (and true readers know how bad film producers are at recreating their beloved stories). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that the actual book writer is a biologist really adds the value of the movie. This movie also tells the viewer about the importance of coastal marshes, and how we should stop this important ecology from being destroyed by developers.</p>
<h3>Barbie (2023)</h3>

<p>It was one of the most absurd movie I watched this year. Completely nonsense, I have to switch my rationality off first in order to watch it and just enjoy it. But dam it was one heck of a great movie. Very funny, very absurd, and very cringe. But it was a cinematic masterpiece. When Ryan Gosling turned into a full blown teenage heartthrobs, I was rendered speechless. I would definitely watch it over and over again just for the sake of watching it.  </p>
