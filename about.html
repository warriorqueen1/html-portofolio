<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a scholarship-student in National Taiwan University majoring in Bioenvironmental System Engineering, specializing in French Language and Marine Ecology. I am a soon to be coral researcher and self-made billionaire, but also a hardcore reader who likes to read while showering or when doing her exercise. I would read anything from fiction to non-fiction as long as it was not a textbook because I am in love with stories. I love doing archery and I won one of my favorite doll thanks to doing archery in a night market and I named it Hi-Hu (because it was a double sided octopus doll). I am also a mother to one crazy husky named Cloud who likes to munch on weasels and cats.
